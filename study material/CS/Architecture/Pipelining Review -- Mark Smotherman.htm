<OL type=I>
  <LI>Hardware review 
  <P>
  <OL type=A>
    <LI>datapath - registers, ALU, shifters, internal busses, and control points 

    <P></P>
    <LI>control signals activate control points to allow register contents to be 
    copied onto busses, to select ALU/shifter operations, and to allow values on 
    busses to replace register contents (called register transfers or 
    micro-operations) 
    <P></P>
    <LI>instruction fetch/execute cycle governed by activation of control 
    signals in appropriate sequence 
    <OL>
      <LI>IF - memory access for instruction fetch (can update PC in parallel) 
      <LI>ID - instruction decode (register fetch in parallel if fixed-field 
      format) 
      <LI>EA - effective address calculation (possible memory access or register 
      fetch) 
      <LI>OF - operand fetch (memory access or register fetch) 
      <LI>EX - execute 
      <LI>OS - operand store (memory access or register write back) 
      <LI>IC - if enabled, check for interrupts </LI></OL>
    <P></P>
    <LI>load/store architectures combine address calculation with execution and 
    allow only one data memory access per inst. (IF, ID/RF, EX/EA, OF/OS, WB) -- 
    thus no structural hazards for competing data accesses by EA (when indirect 
    addressing is being done), OF, and OS 
    <P></P>
    <LI>hardwired control unit 
    <OL>
      <LI>input = clock phases or state, IR, condition codes; output = control 
      signals 
      <LI>control signals are sums of products (e.g. Rin = ADD*T3 + SUB*T3 + 
      ...) 
      <LI>can use gates to generate control signals (random logic) or PLA 
    </LI></OL>
    <P></P>
    <LI>microprogrammed control (see <A 
    href="http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/uprog.html">http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/uprog.html</A>) 

    <OL>
      <LI>package all control signals for a given clock cycle into a 
      microinstruction (relatively unencoded format called a "horizontal" 
      uinst.; highly encoded format called a "vertical" uinst.) 
      <LI>microinstruction sequencing can be similar to machine language 
      sequencing 
      <LI>instruction decode by using the opcode as index into a jump table 
      <LI>parallelism by packing several datapath operations in the same 
      microinstruction 
      <LI>microprogramming provides flexibility - updates to change or correct 
      instruction set 
      <LI>in 1970 control stores were 10 times faster than main memory - this 
      made microprogramming attractive; now, icaches make it less attractive 
      (RISC can be seen as "compiling to microcode") </LI></OL>
    <P></P>
    <LI><A href="http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/464/control.txt">now most 
    designs are cache-based and have gone back to hardwired control</A> 
    <P></P>
    <LI>minimize CPI by minimizing the number of clocks/states/microinstructions 
    in execution path
